# Outcome: Affective Attitude

One outcome we will include in the formal model is the affective dimension of attitude towards an outgroup. Based on existing literature (Tropp & Pettigrew, 2005; Crisp, 2010), we postulate the following working definition: the affective dimension of attitude towards an outgroup refers to the emotional response, conscious feelings, or sentiments an individual or group has towards another group.

A literature review by Vezzali et al. (2013) specifically summarizes 24 studies that focus on the affective consequences of imagined contact. The evidence from the included studies suggests that there is a positive effect of imagined contact on the affective dimension of attitude towards an outgroup is robust in terms of both strong empirical evidence and generalizability.

In terms of the strength of evidence, Vezzali et al. (2013) only give a verbal summary of the findings from the reviewed studies. Imagined contact was shown to increase outgroup trust, empathy, and the affective component of attitudes both at an explicit and implicit level. Imagined contact was also reported to reduce intergroup anxiety. The reported evidence demonstrated that imagined contact is effective at both alleviating negative affective factors, that is, anxiety, and enhancing positive affective factors, such as empathy and trust. Unfortunately, the authors do not calculate a meta-analytical effect size across all 24 studies.

Regarding the generalizability of the effect, the findings from the literature review suggest that the effect has been observed across different units, treatments, outcomes, and settings, in line with the UTOS framework. First off, the effect has been demonstrated across different demographic groups and cultural contexts. For example, the studies included in the review involved participants from different age groups, ethnicities, and nationalities, indicating the generalizability of the effect across diverse populations. Second, the operationalizations of the imagined contact intervention varied across studies. Some interventions involved participants imagining positive interactions with outgroup members, while others used virtual reality or video-based interventions. The fact that the effect has been observed with different operationalizations of the intervention suggests that it is not limited to a specific treatment method. Third, the studies included in the review employed different measures to assess the affective dimension of attitude towards an outgroup. These measures included self-report scales, physiological indicators, and implicit association tests. The consistent findings across different outcome measures indicate that the effect is not dependent on a specific measure of the outcome. Lastly, the effect of the imagined contact intervention has been observed in various settings, including educational institutions, workplaces, and community settings. This suggests that the intervention can be applied in different contexts and has the potential for broad applicability.
