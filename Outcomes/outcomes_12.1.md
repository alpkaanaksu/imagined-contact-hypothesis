# Outcomes
## Outcome 1: Affective Attitude

One outcome we will include in the formal model is the affective dimension of attitude towards an outgroup. According to Crisp and Turner (2012) attitude consists of three dimensions: affective, cognitive and behavioral. The affective dimension is currently considered to be the most relevant when it comes to understanding the effects of imagined contact interventions (Vezzali et al., 2013), therefore we will focus only on this dimension. Based on existing literature (Tropp & Pettigrew, 2005; Crisp, 2010), we postulate the following working definition: the affective dimension of attitude towards an outgroup refers to the emotional response, conscious feelings, or sentiments an individual or group has towards another group.

A literature review by Vezzali et al. (2013) summarizes 24 studies that focus on
the affective consequences of imagined contact specifically. The evidence from
the included studies suggests that there is a positive effect of imagined
contact on the affective dimension of attitude towards an outgroup. We jeduged the effect
found by Vezzali robust in terms of both strong empirical evidence and generalizability.


In terms of the strength of evidence, Vezzali et al. (2013) only give a verbal summary of the findings from the reviewed studies. Imagined contact was shown to increase outgroup trust, empathy, and the affective component of attitude both at an explicit and implicit level. Imagined contact was also reported to reduce intergroup anxiety. The reported evidence demonstrated that imagined contact is effective at both alleviating negative affective factors, that is, anxiety, and enhancing positive affective factors, such as empathy and trust. Unfortunately, the authors do not calculate a meta-analytical effect size across all 24 studies.

Regarding the generalizability of the effect, the findings from the literature
review suggest that the effect has been observed across different units,
treatments, outcomes, and settings, in line with the UTOS framework. First off,
the effect has been demonstrated across different demographic groups and
cultural contexts. For example, the studies included in the review involved
participants from different age groups, ethnicities, and nationalities,
indicating the generalizability of the effect across diverse populations.
Second, the operationalizations of the imagined contact intervention varied
across studies. Some interventions involved participants imagining positive
interactions with outgroup members, while others blurred the line between
imagined and real contact by using virtual reality or video-based interventions. The fact that the effect has been observed with
different operationalizations of the intervention suggests that it is not
limited to a specific treatment method. Third, the studies included in the
review employed different measures to assess the affective dimension of attitude
towards an outgroup. These measures included self-report scales, physiological
indicators, and implicit association tests. The consistent findings across
different outcome measures indicate that the effect is not dependent on a
specific measure of the outcome. Lastly, the effect of the imagined contact
intervention has been observed in various settings, including educational
institutions, workplaces, and community settings. This suggests that the
intervention can be applied in different contexts and has the potential for
broad applicability.

Based on these findings we expect the affective attitude towards outgroups to be
directly improved through imagined contact, with the effect being robust across
changes in experimental design.

## Outcome 2: Approach Tendency

Approach tendencies describe a desire or inclination to approach an outgroup
(meaning a group defined by a characteristic the person themself does not share)
or interact with this outgroup in any positive manner. According to the
“imagined contact hypothesis” an imagined positive interaction with a member of
an outgroup should lead to an improvement in intergroup relations (Chrisp &
Turner, 2009). The hypothesis also states that imagining a positive interaction with
an outgroup member stimulates the intention to actually engage more positively
with this outgroup, therefore increasing the approach tendency towards this group.

Approach tendencies are therefore a necessary step further to a changed attitude to improve intergroup relations by enhancing intentions to seek out future contact and reducing the desire or intention to avoid. (Chrisp & Turner, 2012)

### Robustness of phenomena:

Turner et al. (2013) found significant effect sizes of Imagined Contact on approach tendency, analyzing their findings one has to incorporate the two experiments they conducted:

Experiment 1´s population is a group of british highschool students experiencing imagined contact regarding the outgroup "asylum seeker". In this group significant positive effects were measured of the imagined contact task on approach tendency. A comparison t-test to the control group posed ((t34)=-3.61,p=.001) while a correlation of r=.45 was calculated.

In Test 2 the population was a group of college students and the out-group a homosexual person. Additionally in this test the intervention group wrote down what they could remember from the imagined contact - this was intented to strenghten the effect. Additionally not only approach tendency but also avoid tendency was measured - how much they would like to avoid a person of the outgroup. Again the t-test for approach tendency showed a significant effect (t(62)=-3.43,p=.001) while the effect on avoidance tendency was p>0.005 with (t(62)=2.47,p=.016). The correlation were (r=.50,p=.001) for approach tendency and (r=-.35,p=.027) for avoidance tendency. 

Both tests show significant effects of the imagined contact intervention on approach tendency. The second test reinforces this effect by also showing a reduced avoidance tendency, which can be assumed to be indirectly proportional to the approach tendency. 

### Generalization

From the results of Turner et al. (2013) the following can be concluded regarding the generalization of the effect of ICH intervention on approach tendency. 

The **Units** Criteria does not speak for a high amount of generalization possible. Because the whole population was only consiting of young, intellectual, british participants we can not draw any conclusions on effects in different populations.

The **Treatments** Criteria also doesn´t support the claim for generalization. As the two procedures were almost similiar only with the slights variation of writing out ones own imagination. We can´t conclude that different treatments would result in similiar outcomes. 

The **Outcomes** Criteria also doesn´t speak strongly for generalization, as the approach tendency was only measured through one questionair and it can´t be concluded, that the effect would tranfer to a different style of measurement. The addition of an avoidance tendency spectrum added some variance in measurement but it is to close to the other questionair to conclude strong generalization.

Lastly the **Setting** Criteria provides first evidence to generalize the finding, as the effect of imagined contact on approach tendency could be found regarding two very different types of outgroups.

Even though the ICH effect on approach tendency was tested for very different out groups. The general robustness must be doubted because it was only tested in a limited, non-representative population. Additonally there was some variation in the treatment measures, though only slightly. It has to be asked whether it is even possible to vary the treatment alot more without leaving the ICH territory but because of the limited units we have to assume that the phenomena of ICH effect on approach tendency can not yet be said to be robust.
