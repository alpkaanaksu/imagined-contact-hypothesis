# Affective Attitude

## Working Definition

refers to the emotional response, conscious feelings, or sentiments an individual or group has towards another group

## Theoretical Findings

**Richard J. Crisp and Rhiannon N. Turnern**

- -> range of outcomes relevant to improving intergroup relations
- -> _**not just intergroup attitudes (the latter being one component of the range of relevant outcomes)**_

- AFFECTIVE COMPONENT: **Tolerance**
    - **Attidues** (inplicit & explicit) toward that group 
        - **explicit attidues** (= conscious, deliberatjve, controllable, associated with behavior - self report)
        - **implicit attidues** (= unintentiinally activated by mere presence of an attidue object, associated with subtle, indirect, spontaneous nonverbal behavior)
    - **self-efficacy**
        - _"According to Bandura’s theory, selfefficacy regulates human functioning via cognitive, affective, and motivational processes. Bandura defined self-efficacy as a person’s belief that she or he can effectively perform “courses of action required to deal with prospective situations containing many ambiguous, unpredictable, and often stressful elements” (Bandura & Schunk, 1981, p. 587)." - S.142_
    
    - relevant Components:
        - promote tolerance 
        - Reduce predjudes 
        - reduce sterotype thinking (Stigma)
        - Think more positively about outgroup
        -  Projection of positive self-traits to others -> reduce ungroup favorism/ Outgroup degragation ("cognitive basis for ingroup favoritism")
        - Beliefs About capacity to behave appropriatly and confidenly
        - eliminating negative expectations
        - reduce percieved threat
        - Nervousness

**Tropp & Pettigrew (2005) http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0146167205274854**

Propose that attitudes toward outgroup (synonym: prejudice) consists of two dimensions:

- affective dimensions of prejudice (emotions, favorability, and liking) (p. 1151 and 1152)
  - Emotions: Participants reported the extent to which they would expect to feel ten different emotional states when interacting with a outgroup person person
  - Favorability: participants indicated how they feel toward outgroup people
  - Anticipated liking in interactions (e.g. I think I would enjoy interactions with outgroup people)
- cognitive dimensions of prejudice (stereotypes, beliefs, and judgments) (p. 1151)

> Those prejudice indicators based on affective dimensions show significant and more consistent relationships with intergroup contact, relative to the effects obtained with cognitively based indicators. (p.1154)

**Crisp 2014**
- Many metastudies show a heterogenous and broad definition of attitudes, including affect and explizit measures but not approach tendency.
 intergroup bias is used as an umbrella term encapsulating attitudes, behavior, cognition and additional measure of stereotyping
- attitudes also include many different subaspects including explizit and implicit measures - no approach tendency was measured though!

## Empirical Findings

**Boehm et al. (2010) http://dx.doi.org/10.2304/elea.2010.7.2.133**

> Therefore we reject our hypothesis that participation in a six-week student online collaborative project, conducted with different samples over a period of six semesters, has a statistically significant effect on decreasing ethnocentrism levels in either the American or the Polish student samples (p. 140).

- U: 204 in experimental conditions, 459 in control conditions
- T: online collaboration between international college students
- O: Measured construct "Ethnocentrism" = tendency to look at the world primarily from the perspective of one’s own (p. 134)
  - Instrument: Generalized Ethnocentrism or GENE scale (James Neuliep & James McCroskey, 1997)
  - sample items: "Most other cultures are backward compared to my culture", "Lifestyles in other cultures are just as valid as those in my culture. "
- S: quasi-experimental study in two countries

**Verdict**: ethnocentrism focuses more on cognitive aspects of attitude towards the outgroup and the study examined direct contact with the outgroup in online collaboration tasks. Therefore, the results form this study do not help to gauge the effect size of imagined contact on affective attitude as per our working definition.

**Al Ramiah (2012) http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02041.x**

Measured construct:
CAVE: instruments are developed for this study, although adapted from other

- U:
- T:
- O: Participants completed measures of outgroup attitudes and stereotypes that were combined to form an outgroup evaluations measure (p. 246)
  - outgroup attitude: "extent to which they liked the outgroup" , "how positive they felt towards the outgroup"
  - stereotype: "extent to which they thought outgroup members were friendly, warm, trustworthy, competent, hardworking, andintelligent"
- S:

# Approach Tendency

## Working Definition

inclination or desire to engage or interact with the outgroup

## Theoretical Findings

**Richard J. Crisp and Rhiannon N. Turnern**

- The model presented above specifies positive impacts of imagined contact on a range of outcomes, all of which help _**prepare people for positive future encounters with the outgroup.**_ - S.137

- BEHAVIORAL COMPONENT: **Engagement**
    - **Intentions**
    - **Approach tendencies*
    - **behavior**#

    -  relevant Components:
        - Beyond tolaernace (= explicit attiduces/ implicit attidues/ self-efficacy)
        - stimulating Intentins to engage more positively with outgroup
        - Seek out futher contact
        - engaging

**Turner et al. (2013)**
- search for approach tendency in combination with ICH
- tested explizit cognitive approach tendency after ICH Intervention.
- Showed increased approach tendency and reduced avoidance tendency mediated by increased trust and reduced anxiety towards the outgroup
- Definition “approach tendency”: “The items used to measure approach behavioral tendencies were adapted from Mackie, Devos, and Smith (2000). Participants were asked to indicate agreement with the following statements:“In general,when thinking of asylum seekers, I want to . . .” which was followed with (a) talk to them; (b) find out more about them; and © spend time with them”

> [This article defines "Approach tendencies" not as a sort of behaviorl componant of attitue but as part of a seperte construct called "Engagement".
            But even within this article the relatiobship between these to variables seems to be somewhat unclear. Whereas "enagegemnt" and "tolerance" and therefore their components "approch tuendencies" and "attitude" are first presented as two differnet outcomes suggesting no specific hirachy etc. between them, they are later presentet in a correlation graphic showing affect as the Mediator between "imagened conatct" and "behavioral tendenvies"
           What is more both of the components "Engagement" and "Tollerance" seem to have a Cognitive component as well , making the distinction in actual situtions somethimes difficult.]

Initial thought:
Outcome (Attitude: Affect + approach tendency)??

# open questions/ comments/ conclusive thoughts/ ...

> **To conclude:**
    It seems as though it is impossible to find a coherant interpretation/ definition of the terms: "affect" & "Approach tendencies" and their relationship to another. It seems therefore nessecary to formualte our own definition of our expected AVs in Order to continue with our Model and Prevent ambiguty. We can however be inspired by finding in literary research.

> Außerdem: Frage bei Attidues nur explizite oder auch implizite? Unterscheidung für uns relevant? Wie definieren wir für Unser Modell?

- Studies mentioned:
    - Stathi & Crisp, 200
        - Study 1:
            - 72 participants (29 males, 43 females).
            - AV: Helping Intentions
            - only common ingroup imagined contact condition (imagine belonging to a common group with an immigrant child and cooperating with him/her while taking part together in a competition against other teams) was significantly different from control condition -> not normal imagended contact condition
        -  Study 2:
            -  105 Italian undergraduate students(15 males, 89 females, plus one where sex was not specified)
            -  AV: u.a. Contact Intentions
            -  CAVE: ging nur darum zu zeigen, dass common ingroup imagened contact besser ist als standad imagened contact
