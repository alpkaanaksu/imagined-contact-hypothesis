## Theoretical Findings

Tropp & Pettigrew (2005) http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0146167205274854

- affective dimensions of prejudice (emotions, favorability, and liking) (p. 1151 and 1152)
  - Emotions: Participants reported the extent to which they would expect to feel ten different emotional states when interacting with a outgroup person person
  - Favorability: participants indicated how they feel toward outgroup people
  - Anticipated liking in interactions (e.g. I think I would enjoy interactions with outgroup people)
- cognitive dimensions of prejudice (stereotypes, beliefs, and judgments) (p. 1151)

"Those prejudice indicators based on affective dimensions show significant and more consistent relationships with intergroup contact, relative to the effects obtained with cognitively based indicators." (p.1154)

## Empirical Findings

**Boehm et al. (2010) http://dx.doi.org/10.2304/elea.2010.7.2.133**
