# Group 1: Mediating affective processes
Britt, Alp, Julia, Keno
Meeting: Mo, 9:30 for VAST display about definitions

(ideally, write your notes English right away)

## Meta-Analyses
- Lemmer & Wagner (2015): 
    - only overall contact hypothesis with subtypes, not including imagined contact
    - no investigation on mediators apparent
- Miles & Crisp (2014):
    - No information on mediating processes
- Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) (taken from Crisp & Turner (2012), p. 148)
    - does not investigate imaginded contact 
- Pettigrew, T. F., & Tropp, L. R. (2008). How does intergroup contact reduce prejudice? Meta-analytic test of three mediators. European Journal of Social Psychology, 38, 922–934.
    - investigates contact hypothesis, not imagined contexthypothesis, but considers reduction of anixiety as a mediator
    - contact with a stigmatized outgroup causes the perception of threat, which induces physical, behavioral and affective reactions of arousal
    - effect-size mediator: contact-anxiety (-0.342), anxiety-predjudice (.189), p<0.001
    - U: person, part of an ingroup
    - T: social contact (proximity)

### Review of Individual Studies

#### Turner, R. N., West, K., & Christie, Z. (2013). Out- group trust, intergroup anxiety, and out-group attitude as mediators of the effect of imagined intergroup contact on intergroup behavioral tendencies. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 43, E196-E205. (<https://doi.org/10.1111/jasp.12019>):

2 experiments

- U: 36 high school students, aged 16-17, 19 male - 17 male
- T: 
    - Exp 1: high school students imagine talking to asylum seeker
    - Exp 2: straight people talking to gay people
- O: 
    - DV: behavioral tendencies towards out-group
    - mediators: 
        - Exp 1: out-group trust, (marginally) out-group attitude
        - Exp 2: out-group trust,  out-group attitudes, less intergroup anxiety
- S:

> Across two experiments, we found that participants who imagined intergroup contact subsequently reported stronger tendencies to approach, and weaker tendencies to avoid, the out-groups in question and that these relationships were mediated by more out-group trust, more positive out-group attitudes, and less intergroup anxiety.

    - Study 2: N = 94 hospital workers
- T: *direct* contact!! => probably not useful

    Study 1:
    - DV: perceived out-group variability, out-group attitude, subtle prejudice
    - mediators:intergroup anxiety (mediates outgoup attitude & subtle prejudice)
    Study 2: 
    - DV: out-group attitudes, rights for immigrants, attidues toward ethnic coworkers

#### Husnu, S., & Crisp, R. J. (2010a). Elaboration enhances the imagined contact effect. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 46, 943–950. (Experiment 2)

**Mediating affective factor: anxiety**

**Experiment 1** (*general effect*)
- U: 33 British non-Muslim undergraduate students at the University of Kent, aged 18-24,  9 male - 24 female
- T: imagined contact with Muslims
- O: Intentions to engage in future contact: “How much do you intend to interact with British Muslims in the future?”, “How much time do you think you might spend learning about Islam in the future?”, “How important do you think interacting with British Muslims is?”,“How willing would you be to attend a mosque gathering to learn more about Islamic beliefs and practices?” 
- S:

**Experiment 2** (*vividness*, ⭐️ *intergroup anxiety*)
- U: 60 British non-Muslim undergraduate students at the University of Kent, aged 17-46, 15 male - 45 female
- T: imagined contact
- O:
    - (vividness: irrelevant)
    - intergroup anxiety:
        - Adapted from Stephan and Stephan (1985) intergroup anxiety was measured by asking participants the extent to which in a future encounter with a British Muslim they would feel: awkward; suspicious; angry; embarrassed; calm; annoyed; irritated; frustrated; anxious; tense; furious; comfortable; relaxed; confident; hostile, all from 1 (not at all) and 7 (very much).
- S:


> Compared to participants who received the standard version of the imagined contact instructions we found that participants who engaged in elaborated imagined contact reported subsequently greater intentions to engage with British Muslims, less anxiety towards interacting with this group, and more positive attitudes.

- U: Twenty-seven male heterosexual undergraduate students, aged between 19 and 25
- T: two conditions
    - imagined contact condition: 5 minutes, imaging talking to a gay man on train for 30 mins, during conversation you find interesting and unexpected things about him
    - control condition: 5 minutes, imagined 3-day-hiking trip, found cool spot, describe the spot
- O: 
    - intergroup anxiety: 
        - "If you were to meet a gay man in the future, how do you think you would feel?"
        - 7-point likert scale on
            - akwardness
            - happy (reversed)
            - self-concious
            - competent (reversed)
            - relaxed (reversed)
        - alpha = .80 (Cronbach's?)
    - outgroup evaluation (not same as trust ...)
    - attitudes towards gay men
    - perceived outgroup variability
- S: 
- p-value for focal variable (risk of bias): 
    - experimental condition (M = 2.97) control condition (M = 4.05); t(25) = –3.71, p = .001);
- (some meditorial analyses between the different outcomes)

- U: 34italian fourth-graders (15 females; mean age = 9 years 5 months), randomly allocated to the experimental (n = 17) or the control (n = 17) condition
- T: three-week-intervention of imagined intergrou contect (meeting an unknown immigrant child in various social settings.)
- O: 
    - DV: behavoral intentions towards outgroup (assessed one week after intervention) & attributions of human emotions to outgroup members
    - mediators: outgroup-trust
- S: 


- statistical analysis: 
    - taken from Crisp & Turner, 2012, p. 148: "Intergroup anxiety is the negative emotional reaction that can occur
    - independent sample t-tests & mediation analyses
    - outgroup trust  higher in experimental condition t(32) = 4.88, p < .001.
    - multiple linear regression: dummy-coded experimental condition (1 = imagined contact; 0 = control) was reliably associated with outgroup trust, β = .65, p < .001.


## Definitions:
- Intergroup Anxiety: at the prospect of having to engage in an intergroup encounter. It is most likely to arise where there has been minimal previous contact and can arise as a consequence of negative expectations of rejection or discrimination during cross-group interactions, or fears that the interaction partner, or the respondents themselves, may behave in an incompetent or offensive manner."
        - additional information in following paragraph
    - taken from Turner, Crisp, & Lambert (2007), p. 2: "a negative emotional arousal that can characterize intergroup encounters, the reduction of which is thought to be a key process underlying the effect of intergroup contact."
        - additional information in following paragraph
      -taken from Stathi, Tsantila & Crisp (2012):"negative feelings about contact"
- Outgroup Trust: 
    - taken from Crisp & Turner, 2012, p. 151: "This can be broadly defined as a positive expectation about the intentions and behavior of an outgroup toward the ingroup (Lewicki, McAllister, & Bies, 1998)."
        - additional information in following paragraph
    - taken from: Turner, West, Christie (2013), doi: 10.1111/jasp.12019 "Consequences of trust include enhanced cooperation, information sharing, and improved communication and problem solving, all of which are likely to contribute toward successful relations between members of different groups (Hayashi, Ostrom, Walker, & Yamagishi, 1999)"


## Insights

- Mediating processes are different in different situations
- looks good in meta-analysis -> looking at individual studies: small ns, bad samples, does not seem robust
- Other group: differing definitions for constructs and structure between constructs => compare them => agree on one

# Summary
Meta-Analyses were not productive, due to:
- Did not investigate mediators.
- Were not about imagined contact hypothesis.
Turned to individual studies. Extracted important facets of mediating affect in these empirical investigations.
- Intergroup Anxiety
- Outgroup Trust

Up for debate: Direct influence of imagined contact to outcome? Or only through Mediators?
In this case: Moderators would be influencing not only mediators.
